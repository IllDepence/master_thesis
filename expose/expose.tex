\section{Introduction}
This expos\'e will outline a prospective Master Thesis in the area of scientific citation recommendation and argue for its value. The approach will encompass the creation of a dataset and development of supervised learning methods with a focus on semantic analysis of citation contexts. Evaluation of the resulting implementation will follow the most prevalent methods in the field.

The remainder of this document is structured as follows. Section 2 will provide some theoretical background on relevant areas and give a quick overview of related work. A detailed description of the planned methodology and approach will be given in section 3; followed in section 4 by an outline of the planned evaluation. Section 5 and 6 conclude the expos\'e by listing the expected contributions of the Thesis and a proposed schedule.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Citation recommendation}
The goal of citation recommendation is to provide adequate citations to a given input text. This can involve evaluating whether or not a given input text includes parts that are suitable to add citations to in the first place. For a given section of or position in an input text, the ouput recommendation can either be a single citation or a ranked list of multiple possible citations. A further distinction can be made concerning the granularity of text that a citation is recommended for. This can range from a complete document to a specific point within a string of text. There are also approaches where citation markers---annotations in the text that show where a citation was in the original---are left in the input text. In such a case the evaluation whether or not a citation should be recommended as well as the decision where exactly to put a citation are not necessary. In an ideal case, citation recommendation can even involve evaluating cited documents in terms of their quality.

Given there are a lot of dimensions along which approaches can differ, the section \ref{terminology} will explain relevant terminology and section \ref{dimensions} will give an overview of these distinguishing dimensions. This will enable a more easily understandable overview of related work. (add citation)

\subsection{Semantic analysis}
The idea of this thesis is to focus on semantic aspects of citation contexts. This means, rather than taking into account only syntactical aspects like n-grams, the analysis will go to a higher level of abstraction where the input's \emph{meaning} is of importance. Because the focus of this analysis will most likely revolve around entities, claims and arguments, these terms will be defined in the following section.

\subsection{Terminology}\label{terminology}
\paragraph{Citing/cited document}
The former is the document making a reference while the latter the document being referenced. The contents of can be taken into account when developing a citation recommendation approach, but in a considerable amount of approaches the cit\emph{ed} documents' content is not.

\paragraph{Citation context}
Within the citing document and concerning a single citation act of recommendation, this is the extend of text provided as input. Examples would be the citing documents abstract, a centence containing a citation marker or a whole document.

\paragraph{Citation marker}
A citation marker is an annotation in the input text (or a data set) that marks the location of a citation. In scientific publications this would, for example, be a \emph{[1]}.

\paragraph{Citation function}
The role of a citation or, put differently, the motivation that was behind putting a citation in a particular place. This can, for example, be just for referencing a data set that was used (by citing a data paper), backing up a claim, arguing for or against the overall proposition of a publication, etc.

\paragraph{Reference}
For each citation marker there usually is a corresponding referenceat the bottom of the page or near the end of the document. This reference identifies the cited document.

\paragraph{Meta data}
In addition to a documents content, information \emph{about} the document is also often taken into consideration during the recommendation process. This is referred to as meta data.

\paragraph{Entity}
A physical or abstract thing in the real world. Generally speaking entities like for example people, places, events and topics can be of interest.

\paragraph{Claim}
In this setting a claim can be defined as an assertion which can be judged in tems of its factuality. While non-factual claims also exist (i.e. an opinion being stated), they do not need backing up by citations.

\paragraph{Argument}
An argument is composed of a claim and one or more premises justifying the claim. To illustrate, this can take the form <premises> <step(s) of deduction> <claim> where the claim is a conclusion.\cite{Besnard2008}

\section{Contributions}
- apparently semantic stuff not very explored (cite survey if possible, look at tables)  
- creation of another nice (exact citation markers, large citation context, etc.) dataset like gold standard paper\cite{Faerber2018}  
- a nice dataset like gold standard paper\cite{Faerber2018} but not restricted to CS domain
