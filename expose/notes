- contributions and/or research questions (why you work on that topic, what is the research "gap")
    - apparently semantic stuff not very explored (mby cite survey if possible)
    - creation of another nice dataset like gold standard paper
    - 
- related approaches/systems (overview of related work, ideally also with a table with columns like reference to paper,
                              year and venue of paper, kind of approach, input, output, dataset, etc. [just as inspiration])
    - survey stuff
    - wiki page news article papers (?)
- the approach/work in some more detail
    
- the proposed evaluation
    
- the schedule.
