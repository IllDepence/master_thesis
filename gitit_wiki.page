# questions

* goto example/paper for entity based citerec?
* classical ML, therefore feature engineering?
* other approaches often are a large ensemble of techniques/features/prior work reused â€” should I rather build from scratch or try to recreate/assemble existing things? in both cases: is trying for improvement just enough or do choices need to be justified further?
* ^ pick/engineer vs "brute force"

# structured notes

## general

* argument = claim + one or more premises justifying the claim
    * [premises] [step(s) of deduction] [claim]
    * x (and y), therefore z
