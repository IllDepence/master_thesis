#TODO: normalize for context length (b/c multi citations can stretch size and graphs are done on character level)
#       -> new json files generated on shetland

- compare in context FoS annotations w/ all annotations of cited paper (i.e. look at references to 22k set)
    - also compare to FoS annotations of citing paper to see if it is an "outlier" context
    - (MAG also has FoS for papers, mby also use, but their confidence values are not that telling)

- ensure parallelisation of bibitem matching
    - start

- @preselection: _clustering as offline step_, online compare to centroids
