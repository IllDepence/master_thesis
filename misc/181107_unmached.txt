explanation:

parse_latex_tralics.py writes a log message, whenever it encounters a citation
for which it found no matching bibitem (reference text). this happens, when
tralics can not parse bibitems. primary suspect culprit for this is nmras style
bibitems.
the JSON file lists the documents in which there were unmatched citations and
how many unmatched citations there were.
