One main contribution in this paper is the introduction of a projection operator which achieves the same effect. In CIT we already discussed this operator which has recently also been addressed under the name “reduced stabilization” in CIT , CIT , CIT , MAINCIT . In these papers the construction of the corresponding operator is only possible in two dimensions using special integration rules.

In this paper we use the HDG approach to construct a simple discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations in which the approximate velocity field is FORMULA -conforming and pointwise divergence-free. To achieve this, we first note that unlike many other HDG methods for incompressible flows CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , MAINCIT , the HDG methods of CIT and CIT contain also facet unknowns for the pressure. The element pressure unknowns play the role of cell-wise Lagrange multiplier to enforce the continuity, whereas the facet pressure unknowns play the role of Lagrange multipliers enforcing continuity of the normal component of the velocity across cell boundaries.

The Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method of CIT , CIT has also been applied to the discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in several recent works CIT , CIT , CIT , MAINCIT , CIT . Albeit this is not explicitly pointed out in all of the above references, also HDG methods often support general meshes as well as the possibility to increase the approximation order.

When polynomials of degree FORMULA are used, we show that both the energy-norm of the velocity and the FORMULA -norm of the pressure converge as FORMULA (FORMULA denotes here the meshsize). These convergence rates are similar to the ones recently derived in MAINCIT for a HDG method with pressure and velocity spaces chosen as in CIT , CIT . A major difference with respect to CIT is that we obtain them here using polynomials FORMULA instead of FORMULA inside mesh elements (this is precisely one of the major outcomes of the HHO technology identified in CIT ).

A major difference with respect to MAINCIT is that we obtain them here using polynomials FORMULA instead of FORMULA inside mesh elements (this is precisely one of the major outcomes of the HHO technology identified in CIT ). Another difference with respect to CIT , CIT is that our trilinear form is expressed in terms of a discrete gradient reconstruction and designed so that it does not contribute to the kinetic energy balance, a feature which simplifies several arguments in the analysis; cf.
