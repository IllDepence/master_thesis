*provide “information on the what, where, why, how and who of the data”* [wikipedia/data_papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_publishing#Data_papers)

# general description
* arbitrary length citation contexts (from arXiv papers) referencing (MAG) paper metadata records
    * arXiv centric view: plaintext arXiv papers with citation markers matched to MAG IDs
    * MAG centric view: MAG paper metadata records enriched with arbitrary length citation contexts describing them

### base data

* arXiv:
    * 14M publication sources (mainly LaTeX) from 1971~2017.12
    * roughly 50% physics, 25% math, 25% computer science
* MAG:
    * very large *metadata* data set

### format

* plain text `<arXivID>.txt` files containing citation markers `{{cite:<UUID>}}`
* SQLite DB `metadata.db` with metadata on citation markers
    ```
    bibitem
     +- uuid
     +- in_doc
     +- bibitem_string
    
    bibitemmagidmap
     +- uuid
     +- mag_id
    ```

# generation

* **plain text with citation markers from arXiv source dump**
    * flatten arXiv source to single LaTeX file
        * skip source with only PDF/HTML/PS/TeX contents
        * deal with file encodings
        * resolve imports and include bbl using **latexpand**
    * normalize `\cite` and `\bibitem` command styles in LaTeX source (natbib + `\bibitem[withOptions]`)
    * generate plain text + citation metadata from LaTeX files
        * LaTeX→XML using **Tralics**
        * replace formula, figure and table environments as well as non citation references with replacement tokens
        * place citation markers and save corresponding bibitem text in DB 
* **matching of bibitem texts to MAG paper IDs**
    * try to determine title of cited document
        * arXiv ID in text → title from arXiv metadata dump
        * DOI in text → title from crossref.org
        * otherwise → use Neural Parscit and try identified substring +/- 3 words left/right
    * normalize title and search normalized paper titles in MAG
    * if multiple results, get author names and search them in bibitem text (require single hit of name with more than 1 character)
    * if still multiple hits, go by citation count given in MAG (b/c of MAG noise)
* **clean up**
    * remove plain text files with no citation markers (mostly no/unusable output, few clean texts where citations could not be identified)

# key figures

* number of unique cited docs: 
* number of citation contexts: 
* number of citation contexts per cited doc (min/max/avg): 
* number of citing docs per cited doc (min/max/avg): 
* number of cited docs with at least 2 citing docs ("usable"):

# challenges

* general
    * data size (and therefore technical challenges w/ parallelization)
* arXiv sources
    * general
        * identification of LaTeX files (e.g. `.ltx` as file ending)
        * problematic file encodings
        * missing import/bbl files
    * LaTeX
        * cases where "source" is just a single `\includepdf`
        * LaTeX complexity
            * citation styles Tralics doesn't understand (e.g. Natbib)
            * `\newcommand` madness
* bibitems
    * title determination
        * bibitem does not reference anything
        * author typos
        * formulas is titles and different ways to treat them
    * matching
        * MAG noise
