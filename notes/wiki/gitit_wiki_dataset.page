*provide “information on the what, where, why, how and who of the data”* [wikipedia/data_papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_publishing#Data_papers)

# general description
* primarily: arbitrary length citation contexts (from arXiv papers) referencing MAG papers (i.e. +metadata)

![](/data_set_schema.png)

**→** papers described by how they are cited

## format

* plain text `<arXivID>.txt` files containing citation markers `{{cite:<UUID>}}`
* SQLite DB `metadata.db` with metadata on citation markers
    ```
    bibitem
     +- uuid
     +- in_doc
     +- bibitem_string
    
    bibitemmagidmap
     +- uuid
     +- mag_id
    ```

# generation

* **plain text with citation markers from arXiv source dump**
    * flatten arXiv source to single LaTeX file
        * skip source with only PDF/HTML/PS/TeX contents
        * deal with file encodings
        * resolve imports and include bbl using **latexpand**
    * normalize `\cite` and `\bibitem` command styles in LaTeX source (natbib + `\bibitem[withOptions]`)
    * generate plain text + citation metadata from LaTeX files
        * LaTeX→XML using **Tralics**
        * replace formula, figure and table environments as well as non citation references with replacement tokens
        * place citation markers and save corresponding bibitem text in DB 
* **matching of bibitem texts to MAG paper IDs**
    * try to determine title of cited document
        * arXiv ID in text → title from arXiv metadata dump
        * DOI in text → title from crossref.org
        * otherwise → use Neural Parscit and try identified substring +/- 3 words left/right
    * normalize title and search normalized paper titles in MAG
    * if multiple results, get author names and search them n bibitem text (require single hit of name with more than 1 character)
    * if still multiple hits, go by citation count given in MAG (b/c of MAG noise)
