# general notes

### "story" the report tells

[Too many](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) new content too keep track of (in general and for researchers as well)  
→ X  
—→ Y  
——→ semantic approaches to citerec

open question: how to bridge the gap between formal definition of a fact/claim and predpatt model?

### preference picks

* integral/non-integral citations
* dependency grammar vs phrase structure (/constituency) grammar → universal dependencies
* *similarity search for mathematical expressions using MathML* (Yokoi2009)

### semi preference picks
* cold start problem: *"with every new publication, new citation links are added to older work. In studies depending solely on the citation network, cutting-edge work is marginalized as they do not have any citations yet; this is a kind of 'cold-start problem'"* (Sugiyama2013)
* old citations being old: *"references and citations in a paper are static and never change, ..."* (Sugiyama2013)
* *"cite rec by similar sentences: "exploits the implicit human relevance judgements found in existing scientific articles"* (Duma2014)
* several disciplines have traditions of citation analysis (White2004) (applied linguistics, history and sociology of science, information science)
* important work can be absorbed into the background knowledge of a subject and is then no longer referenced (e.g. Einstein 1905 for the Theory of Relativity) (Swales1986)
    * morphological and syntactic evolutions:
        * discoveries become 'named' (Lotka's Law, the Mossbauer Effect)
        * Proper Name adjectivization takes place (Widdowsonian dichotomies, a Sinclo-Coulthardian approach)
* sth like Habernal2017's *base applied NLP in argumentation mining on "substantial research in argumentation itself"* but for claims (esp. PredPatt approach)
