\chapter{Semantic approaches to citation recommendation}\label{chap:approach}
types of citations (naming an entity, backing up a claim, etc.)

how citations are embedded in sentences (integral/non-integral\cite{Swales1990,Hyland1999,Thompson2001,Okamura2008,Lamers2018})

\section{Fields of Study as names entities}
name name

\section{Claims}
\subsection{Tools for extracting claims}
tools tools

also: Survey on open information extraction\cite{Niklaus2018}

context specific claim detection\cite{Levy2014}

if only papers where semantically annotated as proposed in \cite{BuckinghamShum2000}
\subsection{A model of aboutness closely tied to claim structure}
predpatt\cite{White2016,Zhang2017}

unfeasibility of use of PredPatt output as is

loosened predicate:parameter model

predicates could be grouped/clustered to represent functions as in \cite{Gabor2018}

alternative view: model gives a selective citation context derived from claim structure (cf. concept of reference scope as sub part of citation context sentence\cite{Abujbara2012,RAHUL2017}
