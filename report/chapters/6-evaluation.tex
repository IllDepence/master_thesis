\section{Special considerations for citation recommendation}
train/test splitting (per cited doc, temporal, ...), re-recommendation, number of contexts describing a recommendation item, ...

a cited doc's role (how it is cited) can develop over time\cite{Swales1986,He2018}

relevance of time\cite{Beel2017a}

candidates are only citations within current paper\cite{Duma2014}

\section{Offline evaluation}
pre-filtering experiments (knn\cite{Bhagavatula2018}, lsi, lda, fos, ...)

different evaluation settings (all, CSonly, comparison to MAG, ACL (data from \cite{Faerber2018b})...)

FoS alone, restrictively combined w/ BOW, only directly preceeding, ...

PP model alone, combined, ...

-> not \emph{generally} applicable/beneficial but for certain citation types ...

also mention \cite{Kobayashi2018} here b/c they specifically target cases where more than one citation is applicable (could be interpreted as either \emph{multiple (simultaneously)} for one context or \emph{several options that are all valid by themselves but in the end a single one is to be chosen} for one contexts)
