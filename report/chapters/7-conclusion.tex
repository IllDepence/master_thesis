\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
looked into the use of explicit semantic representations for local citation recommendation.

(summary of methodology)

NPmarker performs best at low cut-offs and in MRR metric. Low cut-offs and measuring MRR can be interpreted as emulating a certain type of citation (i.e. citing reference publications). -> NPmarker is suited for such citations.

Citation type where a claim is backed by a citation can not really be emulated by cut-offs or choice of metric. Claim model relying on BoW "base" to outperform BoW at least suggests, that on it's own it is not very effective *generally* (for all citation types). Might be that also Claim model is well suited only for certain types of citations -> needs more investigation (see future work)
