\chapter{Future work}
As a first step identify types of citations more systematically.

For different types, different models.

Proper claim model. (that could also include assessing credibility\cite{Popat2016})
predicates could be grouped/clustered to represent functions as in \cite{Gabor2018}

marker-aware claim model when handling of non-syntactic citations is solved

Argumentative structures. (Argumentation mining\cite{Stab2016,Lippi2016,Habernal2017})

also data set is already extended with 2018 data\cite{Saier2019}

for data where no precise citation marker can be guaraneed (and so far NPmarker was not tested) look into heuristically identifying marker position
