\chapter{Future work}
As a first step identify types of citations more systematically.

For different types, different models.

Proper claim model. (that could also include assessing credibility\cite{Popat2016})

Argumentative structures. (Argumentation mining\cite{Stab2016,Lippi2016,Habernal2017})

also data set is already extended with 2018 data

for data where no precise citation marker can be guaraneed (and so far NPmarker was not tested) look into heuristically identifying marker position
